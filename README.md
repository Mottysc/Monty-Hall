# Monty-Hall-Problem
I made a little Monty Hall Problem simulator. 

My family was arguing about the Monty Hall Problem so I made a simulator to work it out. 


I made this myself, it's a pretty simple code with not much to explain.
If you need help with any variable names, just ask. 

The code has a lot of extra variables and options that is necessary, I just made them for more customisation. 


I, Mottysc, made this code. You may not steal or copy this code and pass it on as your own.
