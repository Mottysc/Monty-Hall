# Monty Hall Problem Simulator
A simple program to simulate the Monty Hall Problem - a classic probability puzzle.

This was originally written to quickly settle a family dispute, the script shows you how switching doors affects your chances of winning.

## How it works
You chose whether to switch or not, how many doors there are, and how many times to run the simulation.

The program then shows how often you'd win based on your decisions.

> [!NOTE]
> The code may not be the best but it's one of the earliest programs I wrote so I'm keeping it as is.
